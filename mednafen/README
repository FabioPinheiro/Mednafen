Compilation notes:
	gcc is generally required(Intel's compiler might work), and the compilers specified via CC and CXX must be the same
	version.

	Using gcc 4.7.x(or newer, though Mednafen doesn't get as much testing with versions newer than 4.7.x) is recommended; anything
	older than gcc 4.2.x may not work, and gcc 4.2.x has a nasty code generation bug that may pop up and trigger a
	program abort in an internal compiler regression test routine in Mednafen; though there is now some logic in the
	configure script to try to choose optimization options that won't trigger the bad code generation.

	Reportedly, passing:	--build=x86_64-apple-darwin`uname -r`
	to the configure script is necessary for building on Mac OS X to work properly.



Some notes on the source code:

	The following system headers are included by including "mednafen.h", and always will be, so don't include them manually.
		assert.h	(included in "types.h")
		inttypes.h	(included in "types.h")
		stdlib.h
		stdio.h
		string.h

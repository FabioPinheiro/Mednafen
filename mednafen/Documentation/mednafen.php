 <p>
 This main document covers general Mednafen usage, generally regardless of which system is being emulated.  Documentation covering key assignments, settings, and related information for each system emulation module is linked to in the table of contents under "Emulation Module Documentation".
 </p>

 <p>
  The term "movie" used in this documentation refers to save-state and recorded input stream stored in a file, generally usable only in Mednafen itself.<br>
  The terms "audio/video movie", "QuickTime movie", and variations thereof refer to audio and video data recorded and stored in a file, and
  usable with external programs.
 </p>
  <?php BeginSection("Base Directory", "", FALSE, FALSE, "Section_base_directory"); ?>
   <p>
    Mednafen's "base directory" is the directory under which Mednafen stores its data and
    looks for various auxillary data by default.  If the "<b>HOME</b>" environment variable is set, it will be suffixed with "/.mednafen"
    and used as the base directory(in other words ~/.mednafen, or $HOME/.mednafen).  If the "<b>MEDNAFEN_HOME</b>" environment variable is set,
    it will be used as the base directory.  If neither the "HOME" nor "MEDNAFEN_HOME" environment
    variable is set, and the current user has an entry in the password file, the corresponding home directory
    will be used as if it were the "HOME" environment variable.
   </p>

   <p>
    On Microsoft Windows, these conditions are typically
    not met, in which case the directory the Mednafen executable("mednafen.exe") is in will be used as the base directory.
   </p>

   <p>
    If none of the preceding conditions were met, then you're doomed, doomy doomy DOOMED, GOTO DOOM.

 <p>
  Mednafen can load CD-ROM games from a physical CD, or a ripped/dumped copy of the disc, such as CUE+BIN.
  Using a ripped copy of the disc is <b>strongly</b> recommended for performance and data consistency.
 </p>

<?php BeginSection("Physical CDs"); ?>
 Physical CD access is done via <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/libcdio/">libcdio</a>, using SCSI Multimedia Commands.
 Only drives that support reading and returning raw P-W subchannel data, CD-DA data, and 2352-byte raw data sector data
 are supported.  Note that some drives have buggy firmware and may return subchannel data
 for a following or preceding sector/frame, sometimes out of order, and this can compromise or break the program
 being emulated.
<?php EndSection(); ?>

<?php BeginSection("Ripped Disc Images"); ?>
 <p>
  For ripped disc images, Mednafen supports "CUE" sheets, CloneCD "CCD/IMG/SUB" rips, and cdrdao "TOC" files; though only a very limited
  subset of the latter's full capabilities is supported.  Mednafen supports raw, simple storage formats supported by
  <a href="http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/">libsndfile</a>(MS WAV, AIFF/AIFC, AU/SND, etc.), and <a href="http://xiph.org/vorbis/">Ogg Vorbis</a> audio files referenced by CUE sheets.
  MP3 is not supported, and will not be supported.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cdrdao "TOC" support in Mednafen includes support for "RW_RAW" subchannel data, needed for CD+G.  Note that Mednafen assumes that the Q subchannel
  is also included in the RW_RAW data area in the ripped image(even though the name "RW_RAW" would suggest it isn't present, cdrdao seems to included it).  If
  the Q subchannel data is missing from the RW_RAW data area in the ripped image, Mednafen's CD emulation will not work properly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since 0.8.4, Mednafen will perform simple data correction on ripped CDROM images that contain EDC and L-EC data(2352-byte-per-sector "raw" rips").
  It calculates the real EDC, and if it doesn't match the EDC recorded for that sector, it will evaluate the L-EC data to repair the data.  If the
  data is unrepairable, an error message will be displayed.
  <br>
  <b>This may cause problems with naive patches that don't update the error-correction data(at least the 32-bit EDC, if that's correct, the L-EC data will
  be ignored)!</b>
 </p>
 <p>
  Enabling the <a href="#cd.image_memcache">cd.image_memcache</a> option is recommended in many situations; read the setting description
  for more details.<br><b>CAUTION:</b> When using a 32-bit build of Mednafen on Windows or a 32-bit operating system, Mednafen may run out of address
  space(and error out, possibly in the middle of emulation) if this option is enabled when loading large disc sets(e.g. 3+ discs) via M3U files.
 </p>
<?php EndSection(); ?>

<?php BeginSection("Multiple-CD Games", "", FALSE, FALSE, "Section_multicd_games"); ?>
 <p>
  To play a game that consists of more than one CD, and you are using ripped disc images, you will need to create an
  M3U file(plain-text, ".m3u" extension), and enter the filenames of the CUE/TOC/CCD files, one per line.  Load the M3U file
  with Mednafen instead of the CUE/TOC/CCD files, and use the F6 and F8 keys to switch among the various discs available.
  <br>
  <b>Note:</b> Preferably, your M3U file(s) should reference CUE/TOC/CCD files that are in the same directory as the M3U file,
  otherwise you will likely need to alter the <a href="#filesys.untrusted_fip_check">filesys.untrusted_fip_check</a> setting.
 </p>

 <p>
  Support for multi-disc games when using physical CDs is somewhat clunky.  To begin with, you'll need to start Mednafen with
  the first disc of the set in the drive.  To switch to a different disc, press the F8 key, which should eject the disc.  If
  the disc fails to eject, use the drive's eject button, and press F8 again so that Mednafen displays a message like
  "Virtual CD Drive Tray Open".  Place the disc you're switching to in the drive, close the lid/tray/whatever(if applicable), and press
  the F8 key again.  If you're using a standard PC-type drive with extending tray, you may just press F8 to close the tray instead
  of manually closing it and then pressing F8.
 </p>
 <?php EndSection(); ?>

 <?php BeginSection("CD+G", "", FALSE, FALSE, "Section_cdg"); ?>
  Both the <a href="pce.html">PC Engine (CD)</a> and <a href="pcfx.html">PC-FX</a> emulation modules support CD+G playback; however,
  the PC-FX BIOS doesn't appear to be as resilient when dealing with scratched discs/damaged data as the PC Engine CD BIOS is.
  <br><br>
  <b>Note:</b> CD+G graphics data is stored in the R-W subchannel data of discs.  You must either use a physical CD with this data,
  or a rip that includes this data(such as in the cdrdao TOC or CloneCD formats; CUE format definitely isn't going to work).
 <?php EndSection(); ?>

 <?php BeginSection("PhotoCD Portfolio", "", FALSE, FALSE, "Section_photocdportfolio"); ?>
  The <a href="pcfx.html">PC-FX</a> emulation module supports low-resolution single-session Kodak "PhotoCD Portfolio" disc playback.
  Hardware features to support multi-session CDs are not fully emulated; they may or may not work.
 <?php EndSection(); ?>

 <?php EndSection(); ?>

 <?php BeginSection("Security Issues", "", FALSE, FALSE, "Section_security"); ?>

 This section discusses various known design flaws/choices, bugs, and limitations in Mednafen that have security implications.

 <?php BeginSection("Save States", "", FALSE, FALSE, "Section_security_savestates"); ?>
 Causing Mednafen to lock-up, abort, or consume large amounts of CPU time via loading a specially-constructed save state is
 a trivial exercise.  It is hypothetically possible to overflow some buffers on some emulated systems by clever
 manipulation of saved timekeeping variables.  In combination with custom emulated machine code and state, it may therefore
 be possible to run arbitrary host code, compromising the host system. <b>Therefore, loading save states from parties
 you have reason to distrust, or not trust, is advised against.</b>
 <?php EndSection(); ?>

 <?php BeginSection("CD rips and PSF(PSF1, GSF, etc.) Files"); ?>
 <p>
 CUE and TOC, and PSF(PSF1, GSF, etc.) files can reference arbitrary files for inclusion and parsing.  Inclusion of
 device files may cause odd system behavior, particularly if you are running Mednafen as root(which you shouldn't be!) on a
 UN*X system, or cause Mednafen to lockup or abort.  <b>In combination with save states, this file inclusion presents
 the possibility of leaking of private local information;</b> for example, if an attacker supplies a CD rip or PSF rip that
 you subsequently run, and can convince you to save a state and send it back, or to connect to a network play server(in
 which save states are automatically utilized), the attacker may then have access to local private data from your
 system.  The setting <a href="#filesys.untrusted_fip_check">filesys.untrusted_fip_check</a>, when set to 1(the default), will enable
 checks that mitigate this potential problem.
 </p>
 <?php EndSection(); ?>

 <?php BeginSection("Network Play", "", FALSE, FALSE, "Section_security_netplay"); ?>
 <p>
 Mednafen's network play automatically utilizes save states to synchronize state among newly connected players, and
 thereafter at connected players' command.  Hence, any security issues relating to save states apply to network play as well.
 </p>

 <p>
 Additionally, network problems, or a malicious network play server or player, may cause Mednafen to lock up or consume large
 amounts of CPU time processing received data.

<?php BeginSection("Configuration Files"); ?>
 <p>
  Mednafen loads/saves its settings from/to a primary configuration file, named "<b>mednafen-09x.cfg</b>", under the Mednafen
  <a href="#Section_base_directory">base directory</a>.  This file is created and written to when Mednafen shuts down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mednafen also loads override settings from optional per-module override configuration files, also located directly under the
  Mednafen <a href="#Section_base_directory">base directory</a>.  The general pattern for the naming of these user-created
  files is "&lt;<b>system</b>&gt;<b>.cfg</b>"; e.g. "<b>nes.cfg</b>", "<b>pce.cfg</b>", "<b>gba.cfg</b>", "<b>psx.cfg</b>", etc.  This allows for overriding global settings
  on a per-module basis.  The configuration override files will <b>NOT</b> be written to by Mednafen, and they will generally not
  alter the settings in the primary configuration file, unless a user action occurs that causes new setting values to be generated
  based on the current active setting value(such as toggling full-screen mode inside the emulator, for instance).  Some settings
  currently cannot be overridden properly:
  <ul>
   <li>cd.image_memcache</li>
   <li>&lt;system&gt;.enable</li>
  </ul>

<p>
Some emulation modules require firmware/BIOS images to function.  If a firmware path is non-absolute(doesn't begin with
C:\ or / or similar), Mednafen will try to load the file relative to the "firmware" directory under the Mednafen <a href="#Section_base_directory">base directory</a>.  If it doesn't find it there, it will be loaded relative to the Mednafen <a href="#Section_base_directory">base directory</a> itself.  Of course,
if the "path_firmware" setting is set to a custom value, the firmware files will be searched relative to that path.
</p>
 <?php EndSection(); ?>

 <?php BeginSection("Custom Palettes", "", FALSE, FALSE, "Section_custom_palettes"); ?>
<p>
Custom palettes for a system should be named <sysname>.pal, IE "nes.pal", "pce.pal", etc., and placed in the
"palettes" directory beneath the Mednafen <a href="#Section_base_directory">base directory</a>.
</p>
<p>
Per-game custom palettes are also supported, and should be
named as &lt;FileBase&gt;.pal or &lt;FileBase&gt;.&lt;MD5 Hash&gt;.pal, IE "Mega Man 4.pal" or "Mega Man 4.db45eb9413964295adb8d1da961807cc.pal".
</p>
<p>
Not all emulated systems support custom palettes.  Currently, the following emulation modules support custom palettes:
<ul>
 <li>gb - <b>Note:</b> Use "gbc.pal" instead of "gb.pal" for GameBoy Color games per-system custom palette.</li>

"192000" or "96000" on modern sound cards, "48000" on older(late 1990s, early 2000s), and "44100" on older still(early to mid 1990s).  If you don't know, just leave it at the default of "48000".
</p>
<p>
<u>Operating System:</u> Disable 3D spatialization, equalizer, and other special effects via your sound card driver's setting utility or control panel, if applicable.
